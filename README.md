# Minimal Backdoor Attacks in Machine Learning Models
## Instructions
[backdoor_attacks.ipynb](backdoor_attacks.ipynb) is the main Jupyter Notebook that contains the code for running the experiments. 
More detailed instructions on how to run specific experiments can be found in the notebook.

[deepview](deepview) contains an implementation of DeepView [[1]](#1) that has been slightly adjusted for the visualization of modified data points.

[visualization.ipynb](visualization.ipynb) contains the code that was used for the visualization of the data sets using UMAP [[2]](#2).

[agaricus-lepiota.data](agaricus-lepiota.data) contains the mushroom data set [[3]](#3).

[diabetes_data_upload.csv](diabetes_data_upload.csv) contains the early stage diabetes risk prediction data set [[4]](#4).
